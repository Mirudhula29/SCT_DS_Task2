# Task 02 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Internship:
SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship (July 2025)

## 🔍 Objective:
To explore and analyze the Titanic dataset using EDA techniques and data visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset:
- Titanic-Dataset.csv

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 What I Did:
- Loaded the Titanic dataset and checked its shape, columns, and info
- Detected missing values and summarized statistics using `describe()`
- Visualized survival counts using a countplot
- Explored age distribution with a histogram
- Compared passenger class vs. age using a boxplot
- Created a correlation heatmap for numeric variables

## 📚 What I Learned:
- How to use `.info()`, `.isnull().sum()`, and `.describe()` for EDA
- Differences between categorical and continuous data
- How to use countplots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to find insights
